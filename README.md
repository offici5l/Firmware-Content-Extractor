## Extract exactly what you need, with ease and efficiency.

### What it does  
Firmware Extractor lets you pull any file from any ROM `.zip` package and delivers it instantly as a direct download link.

### Why it’s different  
No need to download the entire ROM just to get a single file. An innovative technology extracts the requested file directly — even the server itself doesn’t download the full ROM. You get the file you want faster and more efficiently.

### ✅ Currently supported  
- boot.img

### ⚠️ Limitations  
The tool runs on a free server with limited resources. That means:  
- Only one extraction at a time.  
- Please wait for the current process to finish before starting a new one.
